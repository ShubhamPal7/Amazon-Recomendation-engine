# AMAZON-APPAREL-RECOMMENDATION-USING-TEXT-AND-IMAGE-SIMILARITY 
<br>
<br>
In this project we are trying to recommend similar apparel items/products in e commerce using unsupervised learning, NLP and deep learning techniques.
<br>
<br>
This would be a content based recoomendation engine where we will use mostly titles, size, color and in some cases images to recommend similar products.<br>
<br>
We have used BOW(Bag of Words), W2V (WORD 2 VEC) ,TF-IDF and CNN (VGG16). <br>
<br> We have also cteated weighted models for W2VEC for assinging some feature a weight over the other.<br>
